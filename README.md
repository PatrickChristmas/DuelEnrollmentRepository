This code is an add-on to my assignment #2. I added several methods, and the key features I added are card movement, radio buttons, chip movement, and a changing money amount. Some of these features do not work as intended, however, the underlying ‘bones’ of the project are there. 
This program is supposed to simulate poker and this specific iteration is supposed to test out movement. The point of the movement of the cards and the chips is to provide an almost shuffle-like movement to the cards and to show that the chips are going to the center of the table. A
dditionally, Radio buttons are added to let the user select how much money they want to start with. This project uses all the required skills, including if conditional statements, switch statements, the ternary operator, for each loop, and a while loop. 
This code does not include a do-while loop. Much of this project provides the logic for the game; however, it has some logic errors that will be fixed in the next iteration.
